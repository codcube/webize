# WHAT

fix the web in post-production. some suggest we abandon it, i'm fixing it (creating the "web i want") with format and protocol bridging to servers of the desired capability by adding a graph cache [to the hierarchy](https://gist.github.com/paniq/bf5b291949be14771344b19a38f042c0), facilitating offline scenarios and [automatic archiving](https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html)

# WHY

formative-era browsers display blank pages in the era of "single-page apps" while newer browsers execute remote code or too suffer the [blank-page](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/120CBI6_gIGqKflXoGp8UMpge1OJ7hfHNNl7JLARUT_o/edit#slide=id.p) problem. default browser configuration - a privacy disaster instantly and silently reporting data to third parties as soon as a page is loaded - is increasingly the only state of affairs due to unavailability of plugins like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) on popular mobile and embedded-webview browsers. browsers that aren't privacy messes riddled with surveillytics eager to display a blank page would be nice, but if business motives of the large browser vendors - coincidentally the biggest tracking companies themselves - haven't aligned to give users this basic functionality save for third-party plugins at risk of breakage on desktop browsers and unavailable on mobile, it may not be coming. [Palemoon](https://forum.palemoon.org/) has shown that lone-rangers can maintain a browser fork, but this requires individuals of exceptional motivation of which there are apparently only a few on the planet, and relying on their continued interest is hardly a safe bet.

on servers, most don't support [content negotiation](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Conneg) or globally-identified graph data, only offering ad-hoc site-specific HTML/JSON/Protobuf subformats, making supplying your own interface, browser or cross-site data integrations difficult, tossing notions of low/no-code [serendipitous](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/interoperable-serendipity) mashups & data-reuse to the wayside while begging the developer to craft bespoke integrations involving site-specific APIs, account registrations and API keys, glued together by fiddling around writing code depending on site-specific API-client libraries. nothing says 'browse content' like 'do a bunch of tedious stuff including write custom code involving dependencies not in the distro package manager'. that's [considered normal](https://doriantaylor.com/the-symbol-management-problem#:~:text=age%20of%20APIs) these days - snowflake APIs demanding special treatment and the vast make-work project of [one-off](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/composability-with-other-tools) integrations.

# HOW

present a better server to the client. explicit/transparent proxy and URI-rewrite modes are supported for wide compatibility including [non-HTTPS](http://michael.orlitzky.com/articles/lets_not_encrypt.xhtml) browsers and cert-pinned/guest-mode kiosks. a config for [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) is included as a HTTPS frontend (pure-ruby SSL options coming as soon as i RTFM) while Ruby backend handlers are spun up as needed. servers are made [less bad](http://suckless.org/philosophy/), bestowed with content-negotiation, data mapped to a standard [RDF graph model](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) available in a multitude of formats. clients need to know just [one API, HTTP](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2013/11/29/the-lie-of-the-api/). blank pages are fixed by defining a site-specific CSS selector and/or regex to fish initial-state JSON out of the document or automatically in the case of compliant JSON-LD/Microdata/RDFa. we're obsessed with finding all the data on offer, so in addition to the formats afforded by Ruby's RDF library, there's a framework for site-specific data-mapping and mapping for non-RDF formats: Atom/RSS [feeds](https://karl-voit.at/2020/10/23/avoid-web-forums/), e-mails and miscellaneous stuff you might find on a filesystem.

# WHERE

it's [your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RoINZt-0DQ), and finding what you're looking for should be easy, even if your internet is down or you don't have [cloud](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/04/14/goodbye-gpl.html#the-enemy-has-changed) accounts, so on [localhost](http://localhost/) time-ordered data is made searchable by lightweight and venerable [find](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html), [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) and [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html). for more complicated queries, one can write [SPARQL](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/sparql) as the store comprises a [URI space](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#uri) of RDF graph data. with Turtle files the [offline-first](https://offlinefirst.org/) / [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html) source of state, synchronization between devices can be handled by underlying fs-distribution tools such as [git](gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/low-budget-p2p-content-distribution-with-git.gmi), [scp](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/scp.c), [rsync](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rsync) or [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), at a higher-level by streaming RDF triples to other devices via [CRDTs](https://openengiadina.gitlab.io/dmc/) or [gossip networks](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md), or accessing remote nodes directly via HTTP services running on your personal [LAN](https://www.defined.net/nebula/)

# WHEN

in theory, this project can go away once clients and servers are [privacy respecting](https://privacypatterns.org/patterns/) and standards compliant in read/write APIs and formats. in reality, we've seen the reduction in user agency and nixing of generic access modes (protocols and formats, not platforms and products) in favor of vendor-controlled mobile and web apps, backed by "exciting" tech on (almost always remote) servers cultivating rented access to a small handful of proprietary hosting/API-platforms. basic GET requests are swapped for site-specific GRAPHQL queries - often via non-HTTP protocols like gRPC lacking mature and ubiquitous proxy tooling - and site-specific binary wire-formats with protobuf definitions as proprietary code unavailable for inspection or 3rd-party client-code generation, while we don't know the queries since theyre referred to with the shortcut of an opaque hash. proprietary platforms continue to iterate on the inscrutable black-box dumb-terminal model they've loved selling since the 1960s.
