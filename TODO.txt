try some newer ruby webservers from ericwong etc, maybe get around the 250M-RAM-per-worker issue

fix reverse-dns/ipv6 in dnsd  or use some DoH server w/o our host list for android 'private DNS' + browser doh settings
get rid of GET customizatino entirely except for required token magic (move HN/Lobsters/etc to generic post-in-HTML triplr)
show blogpost as "visited" style no matter which cache server and client are being used (syndicate canonical-URL load history)

hash fetched entities to prevent redundant parsing/extraction work when origin caching is broken - fixes 'non update triggers summarization to changes' which doesnt happen w/ upstream 304 or offline

don't return login redirect to client, return proxy cache
long-running channel tab, for occasional updates from heavily-spaced origin-queries - full subscriptionlist triggers antibot & 60s rack timeout
history -  store and browse versions, eg full blogpost and preview from feed
remember insecure hosts so we don't keep trying HTTPS
more compliant cookie caching on allowed domains
backlink indexing and more indexing in general - frequently linked posts, daily heat
return new graph URIs stored in request - for text/uri feedfetch report

bat signal not in presumably-RDFa content (Can we twiddle HTML datatypes beforehand?) , URI-identified comments from RDFa graph not cached at canonical locaion http://l/universalhub.com/2021/steam-plant-catches-fire
more granular de-utmize - delete specific query keys
ask all the peer-caches (pi/vps/phone from laptop) ahead of origin servers for static resources - HEAD All then cancel remaining HEADs on first response and GET winner? HEAD shouldnt trigger origin fetches on each remote..local existence check only. investigate Squid inter-cache-protocol
syndicate tokens to peers (push/proactive caching vs pull/ondemand above)
investigate the http2/fibery servers some of them can replace squid with a bit of addition in the auto-certgen space
offline mode for mult-GET
systemd + openrc unit files
next/prev links in HTML not lifted to HTTP metadata and/or collide with proxy-added #next/#prev http://l/techrights.org/2021/11/30/freedom-respecting-internet/?offline
link gemini posts to timeline - use current timestamp if server doesn't provide
ruby-net-text is failing on URI parse errors all the time - it shouldn't even parse the body
