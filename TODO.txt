don't return login redirect to client, return proxy cache (IG but we seem permbanned from them so who else?)

history -  store and browse versions, eg full blogpost and preview from feed
remember insecure hosts so we don't keep trying HTTPS
more compliant cookie caching on allowed (sub)domains
backlink indexing and more indexing in general - frequently linked posts 'daily heat'
return graphs cached in request -  fetched updates report

drop specific query keys - de-utmize and other gunk
ask all the peer-caches (pi/vps/phone from laptop) ahead of origin servers for static resources - HEAD All then cancel remaining HEADs on first response and GET winner? or cache availability notices recieved via UDP mesh.

link gemini posts to timeline - use current timestamp if server doesn't provide
ruby-net-text is failing on URI parse errors all the time - it shouldn't even parse the body - write a Gemini client?
