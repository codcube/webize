IRC linepointers are #hashonly, but resolution per-line might be expensive, investigate naive string-concat solution
hash fetched entities to prevent redundant parsing/summarization work when origin caching is broken - essentially generate our own ETags
return only new posts (cached in saveRDF) since full-content youtube/soundcloud/feedlist aggregated responses shred browsers.

long-running slow updater, for occasional GET heavily-spaced origin-queries
drop nulls somewhere in the triplr pipeline http://localhost:8000/https://lilsilva.persona.co
per-site upstreams/proxies for custom archival scenarios. also alleviates broken edge caching (wrt rm -rf .chromium or even just dropping out of the 1GB cache)
offline/online content merge by default? following feeds (API or RSS/Atom) to canonical URL often results in empty page due to SPA stuff, but we have the content already
merge local dir-content at least. for nose following. http://l/gitter.im/solid/specification should link to spec, solidos etc 
history -  store and browse versions, eg full blogpost and preview from feed
remember insecure hosts so we don't keep trying HTTPS - enough hosts to bother?
small turtle documentatino of declarative config files
show request meta in HTML - graph/resource/doc sizes/dates at least (should i ctrl-R? etc)  
more compliant cookie caching on allowed (sub)domains
backlink indexing and more indexing in general - frequently linked posts 'daily heat'

drop specific query keys - de-utmize and other gunk
ask all the peer-caches (pi/vps/phone from laptop) ahead of origin servers for static resources - HEAD All then cancel remaining HEADs on first response and GET winner? or cache availability notices recieved via UDP mesh.  - or announce availability at cache-time of stuff not autoimagically syndicated (larger static media stuff etc)

link gemini posts to timeline - use current timestamp if server doesn't provide
ruby-net-text is failing on URI parse errors all the time - it shouldn't even parse the body - write a Gemini client?
RDF::URI #query_values hates multiple/leading/trailing &s, submit patch upstream 'https://minnit.chat/DOYOUFAMILY?embed&&nickname='.R.query_values
