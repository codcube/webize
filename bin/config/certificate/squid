# distros tend to either not configure the squid cert stuff at all, or in some cases there's a directory owned by a user named 'squid' that you can't login as so i'm not sure how you run the certgen script (maybe some su invocation with it specified instead of the useless $SHELL ?). we just do this until figuring out what you're "supposed" to do on these distros and whether or or not distro stuff needs patching/bugfixing or not. i mean we dont even use most of these distros or squid anymore it was just a product of our distro-hopping phase and before falcon/HTTPS came along so idk whatever just in case anyone uses squid you might need to run this..
