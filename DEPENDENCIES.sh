# bundle: install may tell you it needs sudo, then if you use sudo, tell you to not install as root. so which is it? we'll go with #2. put something like this in your shell .rc file:
#  export GEM_HOME="$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')"
#  export PATH="$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"
# well now you have ruby launching every time you open a shell, which is probably not what you want. you could hardcode it but that will break on every ruby update. maybe there's a way to fiddle with files in /etc to make it default to user_dir. Fedora apparently did it somehow

# Nokogiri: if installed gem isn't working, say on bionic/musl libc (Termux/Alpine), ARM64/RISC-V architecture, or bleeding-edge git/dev-version Ruby, or especially the trifecta of these, there's some more things to try:
# build nokogiri from source:
#  gem uninstall nokogiri -a
#  gem install --platform=ruby nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries
# if this fails, try specifying the platform:
#  gem install --platform aarch64-linux-musl nokogiri
# if this throws ld errors, be sure gcompat is installed:
#  sudo apk add gcompat
# if it's still not working, maybe there's a distro supplied version:
#  sudo apk add ruby-nokogiri
# if that one's not working, maybe ask on IRC or issues tracker for help, with detailed diagnostic info from something like (if you managed to get some version installed):
#  nokogiri -v
# some info on bundler may be useful too:
#  bundle platform
#  cat Gemfile.lock
