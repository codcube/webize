# USAGE
``` sh
cd bin/server
./dnsd   # DNS service
./httpd  # HTTP service
```

## environment
check out [../bin/](../bin/). we use the allow/block/follow utils for quick blocklist or subscription maintenance without opening up an editor. you might want to add some or all of these directories to **PATH** depending on what you're using, for example to enable the dnsd/httpd command below:

    export PATH=$HOME/src/webize/bin/server:$PATH

**ADDR** is the address DNS server returns for names in the blocklist - useful to send traffic to a proxy for rewrites/substitutions. if you have a centrally-configured egress server as expanded upon below:

    ADDR=10.10.10.1 dnsd

send all traffic to a proxy with **http_proxy** set at the client or server (for chained-proxy topologies)

when **OFFLINE** is set, requests are serviced from local cache. for offline-mode with verbose logging launch the server with:

    CONSOLE_LEVEL=debug OFFLINE=1 httpd

set **UNFILTERED** for DNS and it will let everything through, but still highlight new domains in the log as usual. this is one way to find new 'cookieless targeting' companies if you're looking for a job or want to add to the blocklist. similarly running **UNFILTERED** httpd will let you access sites in the DNS filter:

    UNFILTERED=1 falcon -c ~/src/webize/Protocols/HTTP.ru -n 1 --bind http://localhost:8000

## auth hoop-jumping
[bookmarklet](../config/bookmarks/UI.u) jumps context from upstream to proxy with upstream cookies. this is just enough to quell Twitter/Imperva/Incapsula errors without involving HTTPS MITM or browser plugins. Cloudflare and FB often soon revert to blocking requests. it's a huge cat&mouse game to get all potential fingerprinting sources matching a 'full fat' client with different SSL/TLS library/ciphersuites and HTTPS versions, cloned headers slightly tweaked by Rack's header-to-CGI-var munging, cache invalidations from 'Vary' headers or resource-integrity hashes, short token-expiry, HTTP-only flags on cookie visibility etc that i'm too lazy to try to make that stuff readable as it's mostly a lot of autogenerated blogspam and there's ctrl-W for when these cloud-middleware overlords are too much an adversary to basic low-traffic read-only access to the web.

## peers
each of your devices can probably (if it has 256M of RAM) host their own daemon - with the default [falcon](https://github.com/socketry/falcon) backend you no longer have to blow away scarce RAM on mobile/SBC devices with an archaic preforking model. peer servers improve cache availability during network segmentation and reduce pipe-utilization when online. define peer servers in the HOSTS file, and listen on HTTP ports on a private net provided via [Nebula](https://www.defined.net/)/[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)/[Zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/), or use HTTPS on the public net. see [this](../bin/config/certificate) for certificate minting
